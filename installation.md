## Installation

* Run `composer install` to download vendor packages

* Create `.env` file from `.env-example` and update your configuration

* Run `php artisan migrate` to create database structure

* Run `php artisan cms:user:create` to create admin user

* Run `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=cms-public --force`

* Run `php artisan cms:theme:assets:publish`

* Run `php artisan storage:link`

Note: If you can't run `php artisan storage:link` (some hosting doesn't support it), you can change config
in `/config/filesystems.php` like this https://prnt.sc/pn50dc then move all uploaded file from `/storage/app/public` to `/public/storage`.

* Run the first test with command `php artisan serve`. Open `http://localhost:8000`, you should see home page of Botble CMS


**If you need sample data, you can import it from `database.sql`**

**Botble should run on a virtual host. Create a virtual host like cms.local to run Botble CMS. Follow these steps to see how to config virtual host: [Setup virtual host](/cms/3.5/virtualhost).**

## Note

This site can only be run at domain name, not folder link.

On your localhost, setting virtual host. Something like `http://cms.local` is okay.

Cannot use as `http://localhost/cms/...`.

Please remove `public` in your domain also, you can point your domain to `public` folder

or use `.httaccess` (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23837933/how-can-i-remove-public-index-php-in-the-url-generated-laravel)

Follow these steps to see how to config virtual host: [Setup virtual host](/cms/4.0/virtualhost).

Well done! Now, you can login to the dashboard by access to your_domain_site/admin.

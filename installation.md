## Installation

**- Import sample database from `database.sql`**

**- Create `.env` file from `.env-example` and update your configuration**

** - Run the first test with command `php artisan serve`. Open `http://localhost:8000`, you should see home page of Botble CMS. **

**- Botble should run on a virtual host. Create a virtual host like cms.local to run Botble CMS. Follow these steps to see how to config virtual host: [Setup virtual host](/2.4/virtualhost).**

## Note

This site can only be run at domain name, not folder link.

On your localhost, setting virtual host. Something like `http://cms.local` is ok.

Cannot use as `http://localhost/cms/...`.

Please remove `public` in your domain also, you can point your domain to `public` folder

or use `.httaccess` (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23837933/how-can-i-remove-public-index-php-in-the-url-generated-laravel)

Follow these steps to see how to config virtual host: [Setup virtual host](/2.4/virtualhost).

Well done! Now, you can login to the dashboard by access to your_domain_site/admin.

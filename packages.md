## List packages

Botble is using some packages.

** 1. cartalyst/sentinel**

Sentinel is a PHP 5.4+ fully-featured authentication & authorization system. It also provides additional features such as user roles and additional security features.

Sentinel is a framework agnostic set of interfaces with default implementations, though you can substitute any implementations you see fit.

This package likes Laravel Auth but it has more features than Auth.
